# Tips:

# - Only crawl your most valuable pages
# - Don't waste your crawl budget by crawling similar pages
# - You should not use robots.txt to block pages from search engines
# - Do not crawl the parts of your site that aren’t displayed to the public
# - If you have any pages that you don’t want indexed, you can use both disallow and noindex directive

# For example, ecommerce sites should `noindex` the cart, checkout, and account pages
